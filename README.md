# Ekzakt.Showcases


## Description
This repository contains projects for quickly testing class libraries in the Ekzakt ecosystem.  Sometimes, 'quickly' can mean 'a little bit dirty' as wel but we are aware of that. ;-)

Most of these projects are Visual Studio Console projects and use the console project you can find [here](https://github.com/Ekzakt/Ekzakt.Templates/tree/master/Ekzakt.Templates.Console).
