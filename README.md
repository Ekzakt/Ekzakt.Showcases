# Ekzakt.Showcases


## Description
This repository contains projects for quickly testing class libraries written for the Ekzakt ecosystem.  Sometimes, *quickly* can mean *a little bit dirty* as well but we are aware of that. ;-)

Most of these projects are Visual Studio Console projects and use the template console project you can find [here](https://github.com/Ekzakt/Ekzakt.Templates/tree/master/Ekzakt.Templates.Console). 

Individual descriptions and the dependencies of these projects can be found in the README file in each project.
